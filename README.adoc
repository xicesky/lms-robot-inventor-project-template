Project template for LEGO Mindstorms robot inventor

Apparently all the APIs and API docs i found are incompatible with the hub i have.
So i'm trying to recreate the API here to at least have some code completion.

== Compatible hubs

Reading out the /version.py via https://github.com/dhylands/rshell[rshell] on the hub gives me:

[source,python]
----
""" GENERATED """
__version = "3.1.43"
